    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights and build predictive models that support data-driven decision-making.\n"

    "\n",
    "Retail businesses operate in highly competitive environments where demand fluctuates across time, products, and locations. Without clear visibility into sales patterns and future demand, businesses risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stockouts during peak periods\n",
    "- Overstocking slow-moving products\n",
    "- Missed revenue opportunities\n",
    "- Poor inventory and resource planning\n",

    "\n",
    "- Which products and locations drive the most revenue?\n",
    "- How does sales performance vary across months and seasons?\n",
    "- Are there predictable seasonal trends the business can prepare for?\n",
